    challenge:
      "The hardest architectural problem was building an availability system that stays consistent under concurrent bookings without database round-trips on every calendar render. A naive SQL COUNT per slot would be too slow and still allow two users to book the same last spot. The solution: Redis stores per-slot spot counts; an atomic Lua script (DECRBY wrapped in a guard) handles the decrement in a single round-trip, if spotsLeft < requestedCount the script returns 0 and the booking is rejected before any DB write. A nightly cron rebuilds all slot keys from PostgreSQL (capacity - booked count) as the authoritative reset. Admin closures invalidate the cache immediately on write.",

      "Live at tourhill.com, processing real bookings across Barcelona attractions. Atomic availability prevents overselling under concurrent load. CI/CD pipeline runs on every push with TypeScript checks, lint, migrations, and tests passing. Price verification and atomic slot logic have blocked multiple checkout manipulation attempts in production logs.",

The dashboard auto-detects your local Claude data directory, watches it for changes in real time, and visualises token usage, session history, costs, and productivity patterns  all without any configuration or external API calls.",
