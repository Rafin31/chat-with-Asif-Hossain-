# Asif Hossain  Full-Stack Developer

**[asifhossain.dev](https://asifhossain.dev)** · Wollongong, NSW, Australia

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with 3+ years of professional experience building scalable web applications. I completed my Master's in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at the University of Wollongong, and I've delivered 50+ projects on Fiverr with 100% client satisfaction.

This is the source code for my personal portfolio, where I showcase my work, write about what I'm building, and make it easy for clients to hire me.
