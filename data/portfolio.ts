  bio: `I'm a Full-Stack Developer and AI Automation Engineer with 3+ years of professional experience building scalable web applications and intelligent automation systems. I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at the University of Wollongong, combining academic depth with real-world engineering delivery.

On the development side, I specialise in React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and cloud infrastructure. I've delivered 50+ client projects on Fiverr with 100% satisfaction, and built a full-scale Medical Supplier Management System that cut admin workload by 60% through automation.

On the AI side, I build with Claude Code, the Anthropic API, and LangChain to ship AI-powered features, from intelligent chatbots and RAG systems to workflow automation with n8n. I use AI not just as a tool but as a core part of how I architect and deliver solutions faster.

I thrive on hard problems, agile teams, and shipping things that actually work in production.`,
